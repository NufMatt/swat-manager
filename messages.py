## Congratulations and welcome to S.W.A.T!

You're now a full member of our crew. Please take a moment to review the information below as it's really important.

**Getting Your Tags: <:swat_logo:1196404423874854992>**
To get your [SWAT] tag, follow these steps:

- If you have a gold membership, go in-game and press M > OPTIONS > ACCOUNT > CHANGE USERNAME. Enter your name with the [SWAT] Prefix (e.g., [SWAT] Happy) and restart FiveM.

- If you DON'T have gold, open a support ticket here (https://discord.com/channels/738534756538384499/814776227537747970) and request a name change. Tag a [SWAT] recruiter who will approve the change, allowing CNR Staff to make the adjustment.

**Liveries**: Enter the command /swat-livery to apply the custom SWAT livery to your car.
